AngularJS extends HTML with ng-directives.

The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view. 

The ng-init directive initialize AngularJS application variables.

You can use data-ng-, instead of ng-, if you want to make your page HTML5 valid. 



AngularJS Expressions

AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions bind data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.
